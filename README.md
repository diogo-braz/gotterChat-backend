## Project Overview

This project is a backend implementation in Go for a real-time chat system using Socket.IO. The primary goal is to create a scalable and efficient server that facilitates communication between multiple clients in real-time.

### Features

- **Real-time Communication**: Utilizing Socket.IO for bidirectional communication between the server and clients, enabling instant message updates.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle a large number of concurrent connections efficiently, ensuring smooth communication even with a high volume of users.
- **User Authentication**: Implement a secure authentication mechanism to validate users and manage access to chat features.
- **Message Persistence**: Optionally, store chat messages in a database to provide message history and continuity across user sessions.
- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling to gracefully manage unexpected scenarios, ensuring the stability of the chat server.
- **Logging**: Utilize logging to keep track of important events and errors for monitoring and debugging purposes.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Go](https://golang.org/) installed on your machine.
- [Socket.IO Go Library](https://github.com/googollee/go-socket.io) installed.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/chat-backend-go
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd chat
    ```

3. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    go mod download
    ```

4. Run the server:

    ```bash
    go run main.go
    ```

## Configuration

- Modify the `config.toml` file to customize the server settings, such as port, database connection details, and authentication configurations.

## Usage

1. Connect to the Socket.IO server using the appropriate client library.
2. Implement user authentication based on the server's authentication mechanism.
3. Establish a Socket.IO connection and start sending and receiving messages in real-time.
